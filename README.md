## My Top 3 Favorite Movie
1. The Impossible
   - I like The Impossible, is just one of many stories of survival from the 2004 natural disaster.  While bad news dominates headlines and loss is highlighted first, in the aftermath of such awful incidents, little and exceptional survival stories of hope, courage, and endurance emerge to deliver good news and put light on humanity overcoming harsh history.

2. Wall - E
   - I like Despite being the last living robot on Earth tasked with cleaning up the trash, WALL-E wakes up every day to fulfill his duty. He returns to his "home" with new stuff that attract his curiosity and gets excited about learning new things. He's also quite interested, exhibiting his eagerness to learn more.

3. UP Movie
   - I like Up because it is not only about major historical events. Say YES to your lofty goals. It's just as important to say YES to every day and the tiny miracles that surround you (if you look). Carl and Ellie endure numerous challenges in the film. Ellie loses her baby, and both of them become ill. Regardless, they adore each other. Every day, they demonstrate sensitivity, care, and delight, which is a testimonial to living and loving well. Sure, it's Disney, but they got this one just right without being overly sentimental. There is only obvious pleasure in becoming life's companions.
